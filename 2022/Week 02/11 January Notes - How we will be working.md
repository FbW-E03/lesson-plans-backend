# How will we be working?

## The project board

> Feature List --> Sprint --> Assign tasks --> Task status (doing / done)

- When someone looks at the board, it should be obvious who is working on what, and the status of the task
- Break down largers into smaller tasks
- If a task has not been completed by the end of the sprint, move it into the next sprint
- Plan tasks to last between 1 hour and 1 day

### Tools

- [Trello](https://trello.com/)
- Github Projects

## Standups

- Should do every morning
- **teachers will be part of this, we will workout a schedule**
- Shouldn't take too long - 10 - 15 minutes
- Check-in system
- Everybody has a turn to speak
- Keep what you have to say brief (don't go into details)
- Answer these questions:
    - What are you working on?
    - What are your blockers (are you stuck)?

## Stuck on a task?
- Ask for help!!
- Take a break, go for a walk, clear your head, leave it until the next day
- Try pair programming
    
### Pair programming

- 2 people working together
- "driver" is the person commanding the computer / take it in turns
- communication / articulation of problem and solution
- Usefool tool for knowledge sharing, or solving complex problems

## Additional notes

- I want you to think of your project as a **prototype**
- It is an experiment
- You will learn from this
- **It's not going to be perfect**
- Don't spend too much time on the details
- Assign roles according
- Create balanced teams - with all the disciplines needed for the project
