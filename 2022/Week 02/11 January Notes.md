# How will we be working

## Agile development

### What is agile development?

- It is an iterative approach to developing a product
- Development timeframe is split into smaller chunks known as "sprints"
- Each sprint has an objective, which should manageable within the sprint timeframe
- If objective is not met, it is added to or becomes the next sprint
- Sprints tend to last 1 week, but 2 weeks is also common
- Sprint planning - At the start of each sprint, you would break the sprint objective into even smaller parts - tasks - which can be handled by a single person
- Sprint retro / review - a time to talk with the team about what went well / what didn't go well
